# Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Proposal Outline
This project aims to design a machine learning model that can predict flight delays from different factors such as time of departure, airline, origin, and destination, and weather conditions. The goal is to understand the patterns of flight delays and to design the models that may help airlines and passengers to make informed decisions. 

## Motivation
Flight delays are very frustrating to passengers and costly to airlines. Knowing the causes of delays and being able to predict them would help passengers better and help airlines better manage their operations. This project aims to answer key questions such as:
- What are the most important factors that lead to flight delays?
- Can we predict accurately if a flight is going to be delayed?
- How accurate are the machine learning models in estimating the length of the delay?

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing and predictive modelling, this project will seek to understand flight delay patterns and potential solutions to reduce them.

## Dataset
The dataset will consist of **historical flight records** with information about flight schedules, delay times, and external factors.

### -> Flight Data Sources
- **[Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)** – Provides detailed flight performance data across US airports.
- **[Kaggle Flight Delay Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)** – Contains multiple datasets on airline delays.

### -> Weather Data Sources (Enhancements)
- **NOAA Weather Data** – To analyze the impact of weather conditions on delays.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Real-time weather data that can be integrated into the model.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing Plan
For the purpose of data integration, the data from different sources will be combined and prepared for analysis.

### 1. Data Collection
- Obtain historical information on flight delays for the major airlines and airports.
- Get the weather conditions that happened at the same time as the flights.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Ensure that all the data is in the right format and is consistent. 
- Deal with missing data and incomplete or inconsistent observations.
- Convert non numerical features for example airline names into numerical features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations: Histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to analyze delay patterns.
- Correlation analysis: Identify relationships between features and flight delays.
- Outlier detection: Detect and handle unusual flight delay cases.

## Data Analysis Plan
This project will be conducted in the following stages:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Flight Delay Trends:  Analysis of the delays according to the airline, airport, season and time.
- Correlation Analysis: Determine the most important factors that cause flight delays.
- Weather Impact: Discover how different weather conditions cause delays.

### 2. Hypothesis Testing
- H₀ (Null Hypothesis): Flight delays are not affected by the weather in a significant way.
- H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): Severe weather conditions increase the chances of flight delays.

### 3.  Comparative Analysis
- Analyzing Delay Trends: Compare delay rates across different airlines, airports, and time periods.
- Impact of External Factors: Evaluate how different variables (e.g., time of day, weather conditions, and airline policies) influence delays.
- Statistical Comparisons: Use statistical tests to determine significant differences in delay occurrences among different categories.

### 4.  Trend and Longitudinal Analysis
- Historical Flight Delay Trends: Study how delays have evolved over the years and identify seasonal patterns.
- Long-Term Effects: Assess whether external factors like airport expansions, policy changes, or technological advancements have influenced delay frequencies.
- Forecasting: Use time-series analysis techniques to predict future trends in flight delays based on historical data
 

## Expected Findings
This project is expected to reveal:
- Key factors affecting flight delays (e.g., weather, airline, time of day).  
- High-accuracy models for predicting delays.  
- Suggestions for airlines on how to minimize delays and improve their scheduling.
  
Findings will be presented in charts and interactive visualizations for better understanding.

## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations
- **Incomplete or biased datasets** (some flight delay reports may be missing).
- **Correlation vs. Causation** (external factors like air traffic control issues may impact delays but not be in the dataset).
- **Regional Differences** (delays may vary by country and airport policies).

### Future Work
- Extend the analysis to **international flight data**.
- Integrate **real-time weather data** for live delay prediction.
- Apply **deep learning** techniques for more complex pattern detection.

## Ethical Considerations
- Privacy: All datasets used will be publicly available and anonymous.
- Bias Awareness: Consideration of regional and airline-specific biases in flight delays.
- Transparency: Data sources and methodologies will be fully documented.
