# 📈 Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Proposal Outline
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** to predict **flight delays** based on various factors such as departure time, airline, origin, destination, and weather conditions. The objective is to analyze patterns in flight delays and develop predictive models that can help airlines and passengers make informed decisions.

## 📝 Motivation
Flight delays are a major inconvenience for passengers and a financial burden for airlines. Understanding **why delays occur** and predicting them in advance can help passengers plan better and assist airlines in optimizing operations. This project aims to answer key questions such as:
- **What factors contribute most to flight delays?**
- **Can we accurately predict whether a flight will be delayed?**
- **How well can machine learning models forecast delay duration?**

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling**, this project will provide insights into **flight delay patterns** and potential solutions to minimize them.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset will consist of **historical flight records** with information about flight schedules, delay times, and external factors.

### 1️⃣ Flight Data Sources
- **[Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)** – Provides detailed flight performance data across US airports.
- **[Kaggle Flight Delay Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)** – Contains multiple datasets on airline delays.

### 2️⃣ Weather Data Sources (Enhancements)
- **NOAA Weather Data** – To analyze the impact of weather conditions on delays.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Real-time weather data that can be integrated into the model.

## 💪 Data Collection and Preprocessing Plan
For meaningful analysis, data from multiple sources will be combined and processed to improve predictive power.

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Download **historical flight delay data** for major airlines and airports.
- Fetch **weather conditions** corresponding to flight times.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- **Clean and standardize** dataset formats.
- Handle **missing values and inconsistent records**.
- Convert **categorical variables** (e.g., airline names) into numerical features.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to analyze delay patterns.
- **Correlation analysis**: Identify relationships between features and flight delays.
- **Outlier detection**: Detect and handle unusual flight delay cases.

## 📊 Data Analysis Plan
This project will be conducted in the following stages:

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Flight Delay Trends**: Analyzing delays by airline, airport, season, and time of day.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Finding the most influential factors on flight delays.
- **Weather Impact**: Determining how different weather conditions contribute to delays.

### 📝 Hypothesis Testing
- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** Weather conditions do not significantly impact flight delays.
- **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** Severe weather conditions increase the likelihood of flight delays.

### 🌍 Predictive Modeling
- **Classification Models**: Predict whether a flight will be delayed (Yes/No).
- **Regression Models**: Estimate the exact delay time (in minutes).
- **Algorithms to be tested**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees / Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks (optional, for advanced modeling)

## 📊 Expected Findings
This project is expected to reveal:
✅ **Key factors affecting flight delays** (e.g., weather, airline, time of day).  
✅ **High-accuracy models** for predicting delays.  
✅ **Insights for airlines** to reduce delays and optimize schedules.

Findings will be presented in **charts and interactive visualizations** for better understanding.

## 🔎 Limitations and Future Work
### 🔍 Limitations
- **Incomplete or biased datasets** (some flight delay reports may be missing).
- **Correlation vs. Causation** (external factors like air traffic control issues may impact delays but not be in the dataset).
- **Regional Differences** (delays may vary by country and airport policies).

### ✨ Future Work
- Extend the analysis to **international flight data**.
- Integrate **real-time weather data** for live delay prediction.
- Apply **deep learning** techniques for more complex pattern detection.

## 📖 Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy**: All datasets used will be publicly available and anonymous.
- **Bias Awareness**: Consideration of regional and airline-specific biases in flight delays.
- **Transparency**: Data sources and methodologies will be fully documented.
